The sample Fluid template
-------------------------

A sample template file is provided in the "Samples" folder of extension "fluiddisplay". It should
give you a pretty good idea of what can be achieved and how to manipulate the Data Structure with
Fluid. The sample template assumes that the following Data Query has been executed:


.. figure:: ../../Images/SampleTemplateQuery.png
	:alt: Query for sample template

	The SQL query which is needed to use with the sample template

The elements can simply be related with a standard Display Controller:
